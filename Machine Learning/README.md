This folder contains a lot of implemented machine learning models. \
\
The Probabilistic Classifier uses MLE to achieves 94% accuracy on classifying handwritten digits and applies PCA to reduce runtime by 60 folds\
\
The folder also contains the KNN Classifier, Logistic Regressor, Neural Networks, K-Means and Spectral Clustering using python\
\
Lastly, the folder contains a map generator which draws a map given relative distance between locations through gradient descent
