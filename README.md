# Personal-Projects
This repo contains the smaller projects that I have self-conducted: including many Data Structures and Machine Learning model implementations, and multiple designed games.
Also, this repo contains some web app and database projects that I am still actively working on, including the pet finder app and NYC Restaurant Database Design
