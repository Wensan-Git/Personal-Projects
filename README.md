# Personal-Projects
This repo contains a selection of small projects that I have self-conducted or conducted with a university class: including many Data Structures and Machine Learning model implementations, and multiple designed games.\
\
Also, this repo contains some web apps that I am still actively working on, such as the pet finder app. Some of the code base is incomplete and I will upload a demo and full code once I finish working on the rest and launch the projects.\
\
Some other projects include a ChatApp mimicking the backend of a slack chat app as well as a set of distributed systems project written in golang.\ 
\
I also have other development experience such as Database development, but because those are done with partners, I will not be publicizing the code to protect partner privacy and knowledge.
